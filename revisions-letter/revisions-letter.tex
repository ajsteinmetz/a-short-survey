\opening{Dear Editors,}

Thank you for reviewing our submission to Dr. Remo Ruffini's Festschrift. With this letter, we submit our revised manuscript with changes requested by the reviewers and minor changes we ourselves wished to make. Within the revised manuscript, added or revised text has been highlighted in blue. Minor grammatical changes or corrections remain unmarked. Below we provide a list of relevant changes with the Section of Figure number denoted where appropriate.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fig. 16 - Caption has been rewritten.
    \item Fig. 19 - replaced with a corrected figure.
    \item Fig. 22 - Caption rewritten for clarity.
    \item Sec. 4.2 - Introductory paragraph rewritten for clarity.
    \item Sec. 4.2 - Several sentences rewritten for clarity.
    \item Sec. 5.5 - Final paragraph rewritten for clarity.
    \item Sec. 5.6 - Introductory paragraph expanded.
    \item Sec. 6 - The photographs honoring Remo Ruffini and Lizhi Fang have been grouped together and moved to an acknowledgements section after the concluding section. The first line of the abstract, as well as the last paragraph of the conclusions have also been moved to that section.
\end{itemize}
