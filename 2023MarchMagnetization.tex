\abstract{While the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry has remained one of the big questions in modern cosmology today, for much of the Universe's early history, antimatter still played a large role in its evolution. We take the position of the standard model $\Lambda$-CDM Universe without invoking additional novel and unexplored physics. We study and explore the evolution of the Universe implementing the known baryonic asymmetry. We present the composition of the Universe across its temperature history while emphasizing the epochs where antimatter content is essential to our understanding. Special topics will include the creation of matter from quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the free-streaming of the neutrinos, the vanishing of the muons, magnetism in the electron-positron cosmos, and a better understanding of the environment where Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) occurred producing the light elements. We suggest that the methods used in exploring the early Universe may also provide new insights in the study of exotic stellar cores, magnetars, as well as gamma-ray burst (GRB) events. Further investigation is required in pushing known physics to its extremes in the unique laboratory of the matter-antimatter early Universe.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}
{\xred Have first statement added to the abstract. Then picture. Then TOC.}
\noindent In celebration of Remo Ruffini's 80th birthday and his contributions to astrophysics and cosmology and the large number of students he mentored, (see \rf{RemoAtWork}) we offer here a survey of the matter-antimatter evolution of the primordial Universe beginning with quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at a temperature of $130\GeV$ and ending with the electron-positron $e^{\pm}$ epoch which was the final phase of the Universe to contain significant quantities of antimatter. Under the assumption of a homogeneous Universe, this final cosmic soup of antimatter survived until the Universe cooled to a temperature of $20\keV$. This work presumes that in our casual domain, the Universe is matter dominated.

A more detailed description of particles and plasmas follows in \rsec{sec:Timeline}. The contemporary and recent history of the Universe in terms of energy density as a function of time and temperature is shown in \rf{CosmicDensity}. The Universe's past is obtained from integrating backwards the proposed modern composition of the Universe which contains $69\%$ dark energy, $26\%$ dark matter, $5\%$ baryons, and $<1\%$ photons and neutrinos in terms of energy density. The method used to obtain these results are found in \rsec{sec:Cosmo}. We've adopted the standard $\Lambda$-CDM model of a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) and cold dark matter (CDM) where the Universe undergoes dynamical expansion as described in the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric. As the Universe continues to dilute from dark energy, the cosmic equation of state becomes well approximated by the de Sitter inflationary metric which is a special case of FLRW. We present an overview of particle families across all epochs \rf{CosmicFraction} in the Universe, as a function of temperature and thus time. Evolutionary processes in the primordial Universe are taken to be adiabatic. We take this opportunity to enlarge in some detail our more recent work in special topics on: strangeness content, neutrino freezeout, the lingering of pions, the disappearance of muons and antimuons at $4.2\MeV$, and the magnetization of the electron-positron plasma during and around the time of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We obtain the chemical potential and the generalized free energy of the $e^{\pm}$ plasma and explore the spin-ferromagnetic behavior of the plasma. We account for the spin magnetization utilizing mean-field theory where all the spins respond to the collective bulk magnetic self generated by the plasma. This primordial Universe is a plasma physics laboratory with unique properties not found in laboratory or stellar environments due to the high amount of antimatter present nearly non-relativistic temperatures. We suggest that astrophysics systems where positrons content is considered should be explored. Possibilities for novel stellar objects with significant positron content is discussed.

{\xred Break the above paragaph and describe the paper sequence citing the sections themselves and the main results found in each section.}

While the disappearance of baryonic matter is well described in the literature, it has not always been appreciated how late leptonic ($\bar{\mu}=\mu^{+}$ and $\bar{e}=e^{+}$) antimatter remains a significant presence in the Universe's evolutionary history. We show that the $e^{\pm}$ epoch is a prime candidate to tackle up to here several unrelated cosmic mysteries such as early Universe matter in-homogeneity, the origin of cosmic magnetic fields. We note that $e^{\pm}$ dynamics may also apply to gamma-ray burst (GRB) and magnetars in the contemporary Universe today.

\section{Timeline of particles and plasmas in the Universe}\label{sec:Timeline}
\noindent At an early time in the standard cosmology model, the Universe began as a fireball with extremely high temperature and high energy density. The ultra-relativistic plasma produced in the early Universe contained almost a perfect symmetry between matter and antimatter except for a small discrepancy of one part in $10^{9}$ which remains a mystery today. This fireball then underwent several phases changes which dramatically evolved the gross properties as the Universe expanded and cooled. The comic plasma, after the electroweak symmetry breaking epoch and presumabely inflation, occured in the early Universe in the following sequence:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Primordial quark-gluon plasma}: At early times when the temperature was between $130\ \mathrm{GeV}>T>150\ \mathrm{MeV}$, we have the building blocks of Universe as we know them today including the leptons, vector bosons, and all three families of de-confined quarks and gluons which propagated freely. As all hadrons are dissolved into their constituents during this time, strongly interacting particles $u,d,s,t,b,c,g$ controlled the fate of the Universe. Here we will only look at the late-stage evolution at around $150\MeV$.
  \item \textbf{Hadronic epoch}: Around the hadronization temperature $T_h\approx150\ \mathrm{MeV}$, a phase transformation occured forcing the stongly interacting particles such as quarks and gluons to condense into confined states. It is here where matter as we know it today forms and the Universe becomes hadronic-matter dominated. In the temperature range $ 60\ \mathrm{MeV}>T>20\ \mathrm{MeV}$ the Universe is rich in physics phenomena involving strange mesons and (anti)baryons including (anti)hyperon abundances \cite{Fromerth:2012fe,Yang:2021bko}.
  \item  \textbf{Lepton-photon epoch}: For temperature $10\ \mathrm{MeV}>T>2\ \mathrm{MeV}$, the Universe contained relativistic electrons, positrons, photons, and three species of neutrinos/antineutrinos. Muons vanish partway through this temperature scale. In this range, neutrinos were still coupled to the charged leptons via the weak interaction. \cite{Birrell:2012gg}. During this time the expansion of the Universe is controlled by leptons and photons almost on equal footing.
  \item  \textbf{Final antimatter epoch}: After neutrinos decoupled and become free-streaming, referred to as neutrino freezeout, from the cosmic plasma at $T=2\ \mathrm{MeV}$, the cosmic plasma was dominated by electrons, positrons, and photons. We have shown in \cite{Chris:2023abc} that this plasma existed until $T\approx0.02\ \mathrm{MeV}$ such that BBN occurred within a rich electron-positron plasma. This is the last time the Universe will host a significant fraction of its content in antimatter.
  \item \textbf{Moving towards matter dominated Universe}: The final major plasma stage in the Universe began after the annihilation of the majority of $e^{\pm}$ pairs leaving behind a residual amount of electrons determined by the baryon asymmetry in the Universe and charge conservation. The Universe was still opaque to photons at this point and remained so until the recombination period at $T\approx0.26\ \mathrm{eV}$ starting the era of observational cosmology with the CMB. This final epoch of the primordial Universe will not be described in detail here, but is well covered in {\xred Add Ref!}
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In Figure \ref{CosmicFraction} we begin on the right at the end  of the QGP era.  The first dotted vertical line shows the QGP phase transition and hadronization, near $T=150\MeV$. The hadron era proceeds with the disappearance of muons, pions, and heavier hadrons.  This constitutes a reheating period, with energy and entropy from these particles being transferred to the remaining $e^\pm$, photon, neutrino plasma.   The black circle near $T=115\MeV$ denotes our change from $2+1$-flavor lattice QCD data for the hadron energy density, taken from Borsanyi et al.~\cite{Borsanyi:2013bia}, to an ideal gas model at lower temperature.  We note that the hadron ideal gas energy density matches the lattice results to less than a percent at $115\MeV$. 

To the right of the QGP transition region, the solid hadron line shows the total energy density of quarks and gluons. From top to bottom, the dot-dashed hadron lines to the right of the transition show the energy density fractions of $2+1$-flavor (u,d,s) lattice QCD matter (almost indistinguishable from the total energy density), charm, and bottom (both in the ideal gas approximation).  To the left of the transition the dot-dashed lines show the  pion, kaon, $\eta+f_0$, $\rho+\omega$, nucleon,  $\Delta$, and Y  contributions to the energy fraction.


Continuing to the second vertical line at $T=O(1)\MeV$, we come to the annihilation  of $e^\pm$ and the photon reheating period.  Notice that only the photon energy density fraction increases here, as we assume here that neutrinos are already decoupled at this time and hence do not share in the reheating process, leading to a difference in photon and neutrino temperatures. This is not strictly correct but it is a reasonable simplifying assumption for the current purpose; see \cite{Mangano:2005cc,Birrell_orthopoly}.  We next pass through a long period, from $T=O(1)\MeV$ until $T=O(1)\eV$, where the energy density is dominated by photons and free-streaming neutrinos.  BBN occurs in the approximate range $T=40-70\keV$ and is indicated by the next two vertical lines.  It is interesting to note that, while the hadron fraction is insignificant at this time, there is still a substantial background of $e^\pm$ pairs during BBN as seen in \rf{Density_fig} and until $T_{\mathrm{split}} = 20.36\ \mathrm{keV}$. For $T<T_{\mathrm{split}}$ the positron density quickly vanishes because of annihilation leaving only a residual electron density as required by charge conservation. 

 We then come to the beginning of the matter dominated regime, where the energy density is dominated by the combination of dark matter and baryonic matter.  This transition is the result of the redshifting of the photon and neutrino energy, $\rho\propto T^4$, whereas for non-relativistic matter $\rho\propto a^{-3}\propto T^3$.  Recombination and photon decoupling occurs near the transition to the matter dominated regime, denoted by the vertical line at $T=0.25\eV$.

Finally, as we move towards the present day CMB temperature of $T_{\gamma,0}=0.235\MeV$  on the left hand side, we have entered the dark energy dominated regime.  For the present day values, we have used the energy densities proscribed by the Planck parameters \req{Planck_params} and zero Universe spatial curvature.  The photon energy density is fixed by the CMB temperature $T_{\gamma,0}$ and the neutrino energy density is fixed by $T_{\gamma,0}$ along with the photon to neutrino temperature ratio and neutrino masses.  Both constitute $<1\%$ of the current energy budget.

The Universe evolution and total energy densities were computed using massless neutrinos, but  for comparison we show the energy density of massive neutrinos in the dashed green line. For the dashed line we used two neutrino flavors with masses $m_\nu=0.1\eV$ and one massless flavor.  Note that the inclusion of neutrino mass causes the leveling out of the neutrino energy density fraction during the matter dominated period, as compared to the continued redshifting of the photon energy. {\xred ANDREW: Note to self, fix references.}

\section{Standard Cosmology}\label{sec:Cosmo}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent Here we provide background on the standard $\Lambda$-CDM cosmological (FLRW-Universe) model that is used in the computation of the composition of the Universe over time. We use the spacetime metric with metric signature $(+1,-1,-1,-1)$ in spherical coordinates
\beqn\label{metric}
ds^2=c^2dt^2-a^2(t)\left[ \frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2}+r^2(d\theta^2+\sin^2(\theta)d\phi^2)\right]
%g_{00}=1, \quad g_{rr}=-\frac{a^2}{1-kr^2}, \quad g_{\theta\theta}=-a^2r^2, \quad g_{\phi\phi}=-a^2 r^2\sin^2\theta
\eeqn
characterized  by the scale parameter $a(t)$  of a spatially homogeneous  Universe. The geometric parameter $k$ identifies the Gaussian geometry of the spacial hyper-surfaces defined by co-moving observers. Space is a Euclidean flat-sheet for the observationally preferred value $k=0$ \cite{Planck}. In this case it can be more convenient to write the metric in rectangular coordinates
\beqn\label{metric2}
ds^2=c^2dt^2-a^2(t)\left[ dx^2+dy^2+dz^2\right].
\eeqn
We will work in units where $\hbar=1,c=1$.

The global Universe dynamics can be characterized by two  quantities: the Hubble parameter  $H$, a strongly time dependent quantity on cosmological time scales,  and the deceleration parameter $q$:
\begin{align}
  \label{Hubble} H(t)^{2}&\equiv\left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^2=\frac{8\pi G_{N}}{3}\rho_{tot}\,,\\
  \label{Deceleration} \frac{\ddot a}{a}=-qH^2,\qquad\qquad q&\equiv -\frac{a\ddot a}{\dot a^2},\qquad\qquad \dot H=-H^2(1+q)\,,    
\end{align}
where $G_{N}$ is the Newtonian gravitational constant and $\rho_{tot}$ is the energy density of the Universe and composed of the various energy densities in the Universe. The Einstein equations with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ corresponding to dark energy are:
\beqn\label{Einstine}
G^{\mu\nu}=R^{\mu\nu}-\left(\frac R 2 +\Lambda\right) g^{\mu\nu}=8\pi G_N T^{\mu\nu},  
\quad R= g_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}.
\eeqn
The homogeneous and isotropic symmetry considerations imply that the stress energy tensor is determined by an energy density and an isotropic pressure
\begin{align}
 T^\mu_\nu =\mathrm{diag}(\rho, -P, -P, -P).
\end{align}
It is common to absorb the Einstein cosmological constant $\Lambda$ into the energy and pressure
\beqn\label{EpsLam}
\rho_\Lambda=\frac{\Lambda}{8\pi G_N}, \qquad P_\Lambda=-\frac{\Lambda}{8\pi G_N}
\eeqn
and we implicitly consider this done from now on.

Two dynamically independent equations arise using the metric \req{metric} in \req{Einstine}:
\beqn\label{hubble}
\frac{8\pi G_N}{3} \rho =  \frac{\dot a^2+k}{a^2}
=H^2\left( 1+\frac { k }{\dot a^2}\right),
\qquad
\frac{4\pi G_N}{3} (\rho+3P)  =-\frac{\ddot a}{a}=qH^2.
\eeqn
We can eliminate the strength of the interaction, $G_N$,  solving both these equations for ${8\pi G_N}/{3}$, and equating the result to find a relatively simple constraint for the deceleration parameter:
\beqn\label{qparam}
q=\frac 1 2 \left(1+3\frac{P}{\rho}\right)\left(1+\frac{k}{\dot a^2}\right).
\eeqn
For a spatially flat Universe, $k=0$, note that in a  matter-dominated era where $P/\rho<<1$ we have $q\simeq 1/2$; for a radiative Universe where $3P=\rho$ we find $q= 1 $; and  in a dark energy Universe in which $P=-\rho$  we find $q=-1$.  Spatial flatness is equivalent to the assertion that the energy density of the Universe equals the critical density
\begin{equation}\label{crit_density}
\rho=\rho_{\text{crit}}\equiv \frac{3H^2}{8\pi G_N}.
\end{equation}

 The CMB power spectrum is sensitive to the  deceleration parameter  and the presence of spatial curvature modifies $q$. The Planck results~\cite{Planck} constrain  the effective curvature energy density fraction,
\begin{equation}
\Omega_K\equiv1-\rho/\rho_{\text{crit}},
\end{equation}
to
\begin{equation}
|\Omega_K|<0.005.
\end{equation}
This indicates a nearly flat Universe. We will work here within an exactly spatially flat cosmological model, $k=0$.  


As must be the case for any solution of Einstein's equations,   \req{hubble} implies that the energy momentum tensor of matter is divergence free:
\beqn\label{divTmn}
T^{\mu\nu};_\nu =0 \Rightarrow -\frac{\dot\rho}{\rho+P}=3\frac{\dot a}{a}=3H.
\eeqn
A dynamical evolution equation for $\rho(t)$ arises once we combine \req{divTmn} with \req{hubble},  eliminating $H$.   Given an equation of state $P(\rho)$, solutions of this equation describes the dynamical evolution of matter in the Universe. In practice, we evolve the system in both directions in time.  On one side, we start in the present era with the energy density fractions fit by Planck data, 
\cite{Planck}
\begin{equation}\label{Planck_params}
H_0=67.74\text{km/s/Mpc},\hspace{2mm} \Omega_b=0.05,\hspace{2mm} \Omega_c=0.26, \hspace{2mm}\Omega_\Lambda=0.69,
\end{equation}
 and integrate backward in time.  On the other hand, we start in the QGP era with an equation of state determined by an ideal gas of SM particles, combined with a perturbative QCD equation of state for quarks and gluons \cite{Borsanyi:2013bia}, and integrate forward in time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{QGP Epoch}\label{sec:QGP}
\noindent In the early QGP epoch, there are many particle species interacting keeping the system in chemical and thermal equilibrium. In this case, many of the differing chemical potentials $\mu_f$ of each species $f$ are related to one another via the interactions between the species \cite{Fromerth:2012fe}. We can then parameterize all chemical potentials of the heavier particles in terms of the lightest particles in each group. The independent chemical potentials during this epoch then are then $\mu_d$, $\mu_e$, and $\mu_\nu$ as they are the lightest particles in each main thermal category: quarks, charged leptons, and neutral leptons.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[h]
  %\begin{center}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./extra/muCombo.pdf}
  \caption{Plot of the down quark chemical potential (black), electron chemical potential (dotted red) and neutrino chemical potential (dashed green) as a function of time.}
  \label{QGPchem1} 
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The quark chemical potential is determined by the following three constraints \cite{Fromerth:2012fe}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Electric charge neutrality $Q=0$, given by
\begin{align}\label{QGP_Q}
    Q\equiv\sum_f\,Q_f\,n_f(\mu_f,T)=0
\end{align}
where $Q_f$ is the charge and $n_{f}$ is the numerical density of each species $f$. $Q$ is a conserved quantity in the Standard Model under global $U(1)_{EM}$ symmetry. This is summed is over all particles present in the QGP epoch.
\item Baryon number and lepton number neutrality $B-L=0$, given by
\begin{align}\label{QGP_LB}
B-L\equiv\sum_f(B_f-L_f)n_f(\mu_f,T)=0
\end{align}
where $L_f$ and $B_f$ are the lepton and baryon number for the given species $f$. This condition is phenomenologically motivated by baryogenesis and is exactly conserved in the Standard Model under global $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. We note many Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) models also retain this as an exact symmetry though Majorana neutrinos do not.
\item The entropy-per-baryon ratio $s/n_B$ is a constant and can be written as
\begin{align}\label{QGP_sB}
\frac{s}{n_B}=\frac{\sum_fs_f(\mu_f,T)}{\sum_fB_fn_f(\mu_f,T)}=\mathrm{const}
\end{align}
where $s_f$ is the entropy density of given species $f$.
\end{enumerate}
At each temperature $T$, the above three conditions form a system of three coupled, nonlinear equations of the three chosen unknowns (here we have $\mu_d$, $\mu_e$, and $\mu_\nu$). In \rf{QGPchem1} we present numerical solutions to the conditions \req{QGP_Q}-\req{QGP_sB} and plot the chemical potentials as a function of time. As seen in the figure, the three potentials are in alignment during the QGP phase until the hadronization epoch where the down quark chemical potential diverges from the leptonic chemical potentials before reaching an asymptotic value at late times. {\xred Does this connect with the QCD condensate vacuum energy?} In \rf{QGPchem2} we present the down quark chemical potential for different values of the entropy-to-baryon ratio. While the $s/n_{B}$ ratio has large consequences for the plasma at high temperatures, the chemical potential is insensitve to this parameter at low temperatures as it converged to an asymptotic value as the Universe cools.

\section{Hadronic Epoch}\label{sec:Hadrons}
The hadron era proceeds with the disappearance of muons, pions, and heavier hadrons.  This constitutes a reheating period, with energy and entropy from these particles being transferred to the remaining $e^\pm$, photon, neutrino plasma.   The black circle near $T=115\MeV$ denotes our change from $2+1$-flavor lattice QCD data for the hadron energy density, taken from Borsanyi et al.~\cite{Borsanyi:2013bia}, to an ideal gas model at lower temperature.  We note that the hadron ideal gas energy density matches the lattice results to less than a percent at $115\MeV$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Cosmological Strangeness Abundance}\label{subsec:Strangeness}
\noindent In this section, we investigate the strange particle composition of the expanding early Universe in the hadronic epoch $T_h\approx 150\ge T\ge 10$\,MeV. We study strangeness yield in thermal and chemical equilibrium constrained by prescribed conserved entropy per baryon in a charge neutral and strangeness neutral $\langle s-\bar s\rangle$ Universe. Then turning to kinetic processes in a Hubble expanding Universe, and determine the
conditions at which at decreasing temperature $T$ individual strangeness producing reactions fall out of detailed balance between decay and back-reaction strangeness production rates. For further details, see \cite{Yang:2021bko}.

We illustrate our by approach considering an unstable strange particle, say $S$, decaying into two particles $S\rightarrow 1+2$. In a dense and high temperature plasma with particle $1$ and $2$ present in thermal equilibrium, the inverse reaction $1+2\rightarrow S$ produces the particle $S$. The natural decay of particles concerned provides also the intrinsic strength of the inverse, strangeness production reaction. As long as both decay and production reactions are possible, particle $S$ abundance remains in thermal equilibrium. This balance between production and decay rates is called detailed balance. 


When the back reactions are faster than the Universe expansion, which condition(s) we characterize in the following, we can explore the Universe composition assuming both kinetic and particle abundance equilibrium (chemical equilibrium). In Fig.~\ref{EquilibPartRatiosFig} we show the chemical equilibrium particle abundance ratios of composition of hadronic Universe. We have
\begin{itemize}
\item
In the temperature range $20 <T <60$\,MeV the Universe is rich in physics phenomena involving strange mesons, (anti)baryons including (anti)hyperon abundances. Considering the inventory of the Universe strange mesons and baryons, the temperature where antibaryons disappear from the Universe inventory is defined when the ratio $n_{\overline B}/(n_B-n_{\overline B})=1$.This condition is reached in an expanding Universe at $T=38.2$\,MeV. 

\item
Pions $\pi(q\bar q)$ are the most abundant hadrons because of their low mass and the inverse decay reaction $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\pi^0$, which assures chemical equilibrium~\cite{Kuznetsova:2008jt} %(brown line for $n_\pi/n_B\gg1$ in Fig.~\ref{EquilibPartRatiosFig}).

\item
For temperature $150\,\mathrm{MeV}>T>20\,\mathrm{MeV}$ the Universe is meson-dominant and the strangeness is dominantly present in the meson sector with $s=\bar s$. For temperature $T<20$\,MeV, the Universe becomes baryon-dominant. Below temperature $T<13$\,MeV, strangeness is present dominantly in hyperons, we have $(s -\bar s)\ne 0$.

In Fig.~\ref{Strangeness_map2} we shows important source reactions for  strange quark abundance in baryons and mesons, considering both open and hidden strangeness ($s\bar s$-content). The important reactions are $l^-+l^+\rightarrow\phi$, $\rho+\pi\rightarrow\phi$, $\pi+\pi\rightarrow K_\mathrm{S}$, $\Lambda \leftrightarrow \pi+ N$, and $\mu^\pm+\nu\rightarrow K^\pm$. Muons and pions are coupled through electromagnetic reactions $\mu^++\mu^-\leftrightarrow\gamma+\gamma$ and $\pi^0\leftrightarrow\gamma+\gamma$ to the photon background and retain their chemical equilibrium until the temperature $T =4$\, MeV and $T=5$\,MeV, respectively~\cite{Rafelski:2021aey,Kuznetsova:2008jt}. The large $\phi\leftrightarrow K+K$ rate assures $\phi$ and $K$ are in relative chemical equilibrium. 

Once the primordial Universe expansion rate, given as the inverse of the Hubble parameter $1/H$, overwhelms the strongly temperature-dependent back-reaction, the decay $S\rightarrow 1+2$ occurs out of balance and particle $S$ disappears from the Universe. In order to determine where exactly strangeness disappears from the Universe inventory we explore the magnitudes of a relatively large number of different rates of production and decay processes, and compare these with the Hubble time constant \cite{{Yang:2021bko}}. We have
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Strangeness in meson era:}
The relevant interaction rates competing with Hubble time involving strongly interacting mesons are the reactions $\pi+\pi\leftrightarrow K$, $\mu^\pm+\nu\rightarrow K^\pm$, $l^++l^-\rightarrow\phi$, $\rho+\pi\leftrightarrow\phi$, and $\pi+\pi\leftrightarrow\rho$. 
 These rates are compared with Hubble time in Fig.~\ref{reaction_time_tot}. In Table\,\ref{FreezeoutTemperature_table} we show the characteristic strangeness reactions and their freezeout temperatures in the early Universe. 

It shows that once the reactions decouple from the cosmic plasma, the corresponding detailed balance can be broken and the inverse decay reactions are acting like a "hole" in the strangeness abundance "pot”.
The first reaction to become slower compared to Hubble time $1/H$ is the weak interaction $\mu^\pm+\nu_{\mu}\rightarrow K^\pm$ at $T_f^{K^\pm}=33.8\,\mathrm{MeV}$. This is followed by the electromagnetic process $l^-+l^+\rightarrow\phi$ at $T_f^\phi=23\sim25\,\mathrm{MeV}$. At $T_f^K=19.8\,\mathrm{MeV}$ the hadronic reaction $\pi+\pi\rightarrow K$ becomes slower than the Hubble expansion. The reactions $\gamma+\gamma\rightarrow\pi$ and $\rho+\pi\leftrightarrow\phi$ are faster compared to $1/H$. However, the $\rho\to\pi+\pi$ lifetime (black dashed line in Fig.~\ref{reaction_time_tot}) is smaller than the reaction $\rho+\pi\leftrightarrow\phi$; in this case, most of $\rho$-meson decays faster, thus are absent and cannot contribute to the strangeness creation in the meson sector. Below the temperature $T<20$\,MeV, all the detail balances in the strange meson reactions are broken and the strangeness in the meson sector should disappear rapidly, were it not for the small number of baryons present in the Universe.

\item \textbf{Strangeness in hyperons era:}
In order to understand strangeness in hyperons, we evaluated the reaction $\pi +N\rightarrow K+\Lambda$, the strangeness exchange reaction $\overline{K}+N\rightarrow \Lambda+\pi$, and the strangeness decay $\Lambda\rightarrow N+\pi$, in detail.The general form for thermal reaction rate per volume is discussed in~\cite{Letessier:2002gp} (Eq.(17.16), Chapter 17).
 
 In Fig.(\ref{Lambda_Rate_volume.fig}) we saw that for $T<20$\,MeV, the reactions for the hyperon $\Lambda$ production is dominated by $\overline{K}+N\leftrightarrow\Lambda+\pi$. Both strangeness and anti-strangeness disappear from the Universe via the reactions $\Lambda\rightarrow N+\pi$ and $K\to\pi+\pi$, keeping the $s=\bar s$. Beginning with $T=12.9$ MeV, the dominant reaction is $\Lambda\leftrightarrow N+\pi$, which shows that at a lower temperature we still have (very little) strangeness remnant in the $\Lambda$. In this case, the strangeness abundance becomes asymmetric and we have $s\gg\bar{s}$ in the early Universe. Hence, strange hyperons and anti hyperons could enter into dynamic nonequilibrium condition including $\langle s-\bar s\rangle \ne 0$.

\end{itemize}
The primary conclusion of the study of strangeness production and content in the early Universe, following on QGP hadronization, is that the relevant temperature domains indicate a complex interplay between baryon and meson (strange and non-strange) abundances and non-trivial decoupling from equilibrium for strange and non-strange mesons.



\subsection{Pion Abundance in the Early Universe}\label{subsec:Pions}
\noindent In general, $\pi^0$ in the QED plasma is produced predominantly in the thermal two photon fusion:
\begin{align}
\gamma+\gamma \rightarrow \pi^0 ,\qquad e^-+e^+ \rightarrow \pi^0. 
\end{align}
These formation processes are the inverse of the decay process of $\pi^0$ where the vaccum lifespan $\tau_{\pi^0}^0=(8.4\pm0.6)\times10^{-17} {\rm s}$. The smallness of the electro-formation of $\pi^0$ is characterized by the small  branching ratio in $\pi^0$ decay $B=\Gamma_{ee}/\Gamma_{\gamma\gamma}=6.2\pm 0.5 10^{-8}$.
For $\pi^{\pm}$ can be produced in $\pi^0\pi^0$ charge exchange scattering:
\begin{align}
\pi^0 + \pi^0 \rightarrow \pi^{+} + \pi^{-}, \qquad\gamma+\gamma \rightarrow \pi^{+} + \pi^{-}, \qquad
e^+ + e^- \rightarrow \pi^{+} + \pi^{-}. 
\end{align}
We find  that for $\pi^{\pm}$ production, the last two processes are much slower compared to the first, in case that $\pi^0$ density is near chemical equilibrium.
Similarly, the two-photon fusion to two $\pi^0$:
\begin{align}
\gamma + \gamma \rightarrow \pi^0 + \pi^0, \label{ggpi0pi0}
\end{align}
turns out, as expected, to be much smaller than one $\pi^0$ production. It is
a reaction of higher order in $\alpha$ and the energy is shared between two final particles. Fig \ref{taumupi} shows the invariant production rates $R$ of pion(on right) and relaxation time (on left) for the different processes considered as function of temperature $T\in [3,50]$ MeV. The general form for invariant production rates and relaxation time is discussed in paper \cite{Kuznetsova:2008jt}. 

In Fig.\ref{taumupi} (on left), it shows that $\gamma+\gamma\to \pi^0$(solid blue line) is the dominant mechanism of pion production. The other solid line with dots corresponds to $e^++e^-\to \pi^0$ reaction which in essence remains, in comparison, insignificant. Its importance follows from the fact that it provides the second most dominant path to $\pi_0$ formation at lowest temperatures considered. In such an environment the yield of $\pi^0$ is expected to be
near chemical equilibrium, since the decay rate is compensated by the production rate, and within $100$ as, the chemical equilibrium yield is attained. We apply the same method in early Universe and show that $\pi^0$ is in chemical equilibrium with photons at all temperature of interest \cite{Kuznetsova:2009xh}

\section{Leptonic Epoch} \label{sec:ElectronPositronNeutrino}
\noindent The leptonic epoch dominated by photons and both charged and neutral leptons is notable for being the last time where neutrinos played an active role in the Universe's thermal dynamics before decoupling and becoming free-streaming. We also note that in the early stage of this plasma after the hadronization era ended $T\approx\mathcal{O}(10\MeV)$ that neutrinos represented the highest energy density followed by the light charged leptons and then finally the photons. The reason for this hierarchy is explained by the degrees of freedom available in each species in thermal equilibrium. While photons only exhibit two helicity degrees of freedom, the charged light leptons could manifest as both matter (electrons), antimatter (positrons) and as well as two helicities. The neutral leptons made up of the neutrinos however had three species boosting their energy density in that period. The measured degrees of freedom also adds a constraint on whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles. If neutrinos are Dirac-like and have right-handed components, then it is necessary these fields do not become sufficiently populated thermally during this epoch. {\xred ANDREW: Check degrees of freedom argument. Also add bit about the inflated fraction of measured neutrino degrees of freedom due to inflating of the $\nu_{e}\bar{\nu}_{e}$ population during electron-positron annihilation after freezeout. Also note the thermalization of the BBN photons can only proceed through the $e^{\pm}$ population as photons do not couple to themselves easily. Perhaps stick this in another section though as this might be too early.}

\subsection{Muon Abundance in the Early Universe} \label{sec:Muons}
\noindent Muon abundance is an important quantity required for the understanding of several fundamental questions regarding the properties of the primordial Universe. Our interest in strangeness flavor freeze-out in the early Universe \cite{Yang:2021bko} requires an understanding of the abundance of muons in the early Universe. The specific question needing an answer is at which temperature muons remain in abundance (chemical) equilibrium established predominantly by electromagnetic and weak interaction processes, allowing detailed-balance back-reactions to influence strangeness abundance.

In the cosmic plasma, muons can be produced by the interaction processes 
\begin{align} 
&\gamma+\gamma\longrightarrow\mu^++\mu^-,\qquad & e^++e^-\longrightarrow \mu^++\mu^-\;,\\
&\pi^-\longrightarrow\mu^-+\bar{\nu}_\mu,\qquad & \pi^+\longrightarrow\mu^++\nu_\mu\;.
\end{align}
The back reaction for all the above processes is in detailed balance, provided all particles shown on the right-hand side (RHS) exist in chemical abundance equilibrium in the Universe. We recall the vacuum lifetime of pions $\tau_\pi=2.6033\times10^{-8}$ sec. 

However, all produced muons can decay 
\begin{equation}
\mu^-\rightarrow\nu_\mu+e^-+\bar{\nu}_e,\qquad \mu^+\rightarrow\bar{\nu}_\mu+e^++\nu_e\,
\end{equation} 
with the vacuum life time $\tau_{\mu}=2.197 \times 10^{-6}\mathrm{sec}$. In the paper \cite{Rafelski:2021aey} we evaluate the production and decay rates of muons in the cosmic plasma as a function of temperature. This allows for determining when exactly the muon abundance disappears. In Fig(\ref{muon_fig}) we show the invariant thermal reaction rates per volume and time for the relevance muon reactions. By comparing the production and decay rates we obtain the temperature at which muons disappear from the Universe is $T_\mathrm{dis} = 4.20$ MeV.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[h]
%\begin{center}

%\includegraphics[width=0.47\columnwidth]{DensityRatio_new2.jpg}
\caption{The thermal reaction rate per volume for different reactions as a function of temperature adapted from paper \cite{Rafelski:2021aey}. It shows that dominant reactions for $\mu^\pm$ production are ${\gamma+\gamma\to\mu^++\mu^-}$ and $e^++e^-\to\mu^++\mu^-$, and the total production rate cross the decay rate of $\mu^\pm$ at temperature $T_\mathrm{dis}\approx 4.20$ MeV.}
\label{muon_fig} 
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As the temperature decreases in the expanding Universe, the initially dominant production rates become smaller and cross the decay rates. Muon abundance disappears as soon as any decay rate is faster than the fastest production rate. Considering the slow speed of the Universe's expansion the muon disappearance is sudden, the muon abundance thus disappears as soon as a decay rate crosses the dominant production rate. Specifically, after the Universe cools below the temperature $T_\mathrm{dis} = 4.20$ MeV, the dominant reaction is the muon decay.

The density ratio at $T=T_\mathrm{dis}$ is $n_{\mu^\pm}/n_\mathrm{B}\approx0.91$ \cite{Yang:2021bko} . This means that the muon abundance may still be able to influence baryon evolution because their number density is comparable to the baryon density. This offers a new and tantalizing model-building opportunity for  baryon-antibaryon separation in the primordial Universe, strangelet formation, and perhaps other exotic primordial structure formation mechanisms.

\subsection{Neutrino Masses and Oscillation} \label{sec:Neutrinos}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\xred Neutrinos are believed to have a small, but nonzero mass due to the measurement of flavor oscillation.}
    \item {\xred Introduce Dirac versus Majorana neutrinos. Briefly discuss See-saw mechanism of Neutrinos with both Dirac and Majorana masses.}

    \item {\xred Fingerprints in the contemporary neutrino cosmic background.}
\end{itemize}
{\xblue Some material for neutrino oscillation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard neutrino oscillation:
    In the standard treatment neutrinos which are produced or detected in charge current weak interaction processes are described by the flavor eigenstates, but they propagate through space as mass eigenstates. In the case of a non-vanishing rest mass of the neutrino the flavor and mass eigenstates are not necessarily identical. This allows for the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations.
    \begin{align}
		|\nu_\alpha\rangle=\sum_k^nU^\ast_{\alpha k}|\nu_k\rangle, \qquad\alpha=e,\mu,\tau,\qquad k=1,2,3,\dots,n
		\end{align}
   where $U$ is the mixing matrix. Considering the plane wave relativistic neutrino limit, the vacuum oscillation probability between flavors $\nu_\alpha$ and $\nu_\beta$ can be written as
   \begin{align}
    P_{\alpha\rightarrow\beta}
    =\sum_{k,j}U^\ast_{\alpha k}U_{\beta k}U_{\alpha j}U^\ast_{\beta j}\exp{\left(-i\frac{\Delta m^2_{kj}}{2E}L\right)},\qquad\Delta m^2_{kj}\equiv{m^2_k-m^2_j}
    \end{align}
    where $L$ is the distance traveled by the neutrino between production and detection. The square mass difference $\Delta m^2_{kj}$ can be measured from different experiments \cite{ParticleDataGroup:2022pth}. In general, the neutrino mass eigenvalue $m_i$ can be ordered in the normal mass hierarchy or inverted mass hierarchy.


    \item Neutrino oscillation during the freezeout:
    In our neutrino frezzeout paper \cite{Birrell:2012gg}, we didn't consider the neutrino oscillations during the freezeout. However, we expect that incorporating the oscillation in the freezeout calculation would give a smaller freezeout temperature difference between diffierent neutrino flavors. In reference\cite{Mangano:2005cc}, Mangano study the neutrino freezeout including flavour oscillations, and shows that the effect of neutrino oscillations is negligible.


\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Neutrino freezeout in early Universe}\label{sec:Freezeout}
\noindent The relic neutrino background is believed to be a  well-preserved probe of a Universe only a second old. The properties of the neutrino background are influenced by the details of the freeze-out or decoupling process at a temperature $T=\mathcal{O}(1\,MeV)$. In general, The freeze-out process, whereby a particle species stops interacting and decouples from the photon background, involves several steps that lead to the final form of the free-streaming momentum distribution. We outline the freezeout properties, including what distinguishes it from the equilibrium distributions as follow\cite{Birrell:2012gg}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
Chemical freeze-out of a particle species occurs at the temperature, 
$T_{ch}$, when particle number changing processes slow down and the particle abundance can no longer be maintained at an equilibrium level. Prior to the  chemical freeze-out temperature,  number changing processes are significant and keep the particle in chemical (and thermal) equilibrium, implying that the distribution function has the Fermi-Dirac form, obtained by maximizing entropy at fixed energy
\begin{equation}\label{equilibrium}
f_{c}(t,E)=\frac{1}{\exp(E/T)+1}, \text{ for } T(t)> T_{ch}.
\end{equation}

\item
Kinetic freeze-out occurs at the temperature, $T_f$, when momentum exchanging interactions no longer occur rapidly enough to maintain an equilibrium momentum distribution. When $T_f<T(t)<T_{ch}$, the number changing process  no longer occurs rapidly enough to keep the distribution in chemical equilibrium but there is still sufficient momentum exchange to keep the distribution in thermal equilibrium.  The distribution function is therefore obtained by maximizing entropy, with fixed energy, particle number, and antiparticle number separately,  implying that the distribution function has the form
\begin{equation}\label{kinetic_equilib}
f_k(t,E)=\frac{1}{\Upsilon^{-1}\exp(E/T)+1}, \text{ for }T_f< T(t)< T_{ch}.
\end{equation}
The fugacity
\begin{equation}
\Upsilon(t)\equiv e^{\sigma(t)}
\end{equation}
 controls the occupancy of phase space and is necessary once $T(t)<T_{ch}$ in order to conserve particle number. See \cite{Birrell:2012gg} for a detailed discussion of its significance.
 
\item
For $T(t)<T_f$ there are no longer any significant interactions that couple the particle species of interest and so they begin to free-stream through the Universe, i.e. travel on geodesics without scattering.  The Einstein Vlasov equation can be solved, see \cite{Choquet-Bruhat:2009xil}, to yield the free-streaming momentum distribution
\begin{equation}\label{free_stream_dist}
f(t,E)=\frac{1}{\Upsilon^{-1}e^{\sqrt{p^2/T^2+m^2 /T_f^2}}+ 1}
\end{equation}
where the free-streaming effective temperature
\begin{equation}\label{T_freestream_dist}
T(t)=\frac{T_fa(t_k)}{a(t)}
\end{equation}
is obtained by redshifting the temperature at kinetic freeze-out. The corresponding free-streaming energy density, pressure, and number densities are given by
\begin{align}
\rho&=\frac{d}{2\pi^2}\!\int_0^\infty\!\!\!\frac{\left(m^2+p^2\right)^{1/2}p^2dp }{\Upsilon^{-1}e^{\sqrt{p^2/T^2+m^2/T_f^2}}+ 1},\label{freestream_rho}\\[0.2cm]
P&=\frac{d}{6\pi^2}\!\int_0^\infty\!\!\!\frac{\left(m^2+p^2\right)^{-1/2}p^4dp }{\Upsilon^{-1} e^{\sqrt{p^2/T^2+m^2/T_f^2}}+ 1},\label{freestream_P}\\[0.2cm]
n&=\frac{d}{2\pi^2}\!\int_0^\infty\!\!\!\frac{p^2dp }{\Upsilon^{-1}e^{\sqrt{p^2/T^2+m^2/T_f^2}}+ 1},
\label{num_density}
\end{align}
where $d$ is the degeneracy of the particle species. These differ from the corresponding expressions for an equilibrium distribution in Minkowski space by the replacement $m\rightarrow m T(t)/T_f$  {\em only} in the exponential. 
\end{itemize}
The separation of the freeze-out process into these three regimes is of course only an approximation.  In principle, there is a smooth transition between them.  However, it is a very useful approximation in cosmology.  See \cite{Mangano:2005cc,Birrell:2014gea} for methods capable of resolving these smooth transitions.

 \end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 To estimate the freezeout temperature we need to solve the Boltzmann equation with different types of collision terms. In paper \cite{Birrell:2014uka} we detail a new method for analytically simplifying the collision integrals and show that the neutrino freezeout temperature which is in turn controlled by the standard model (SM) of particle physics  parameters. The freezeout temperature depends only on the magnitude of the Weinberg angle in the form $\sin^2\theta_W$ , and a dimensionless relative interaction strength parameter $\eta$,
\begin{align}
\eta\equiv M_p m_e^3 G_F^2, \qquad M_p^2\equiv \frac{1}{8\pi G_N}, \end{align}
a combination of  the electron mass $m_e$, Newton constant $G_N$, and the Fermi constant $G_F$. The dimensionless interaction strength parameter $\eta$ with the vacuum present-day value is given by
\begin{align}
\eta_0\equiv \left.M_p m_e^3 G_F^2\right|_0  = 0.04421 .
\end{align}
The magnitude of  $\sin^2\theta_W$ is not fixed within the SM and  could be subject to variation as a function of time or temperature. In Fig.(\ref{fig:freezeoutT}) we show the dependence of neutrino freezeout temperatures for $\nu_e$ and $\nu_{\mu,\tau}$ on SM model parameters  $\sin^2\theta_W$ and $\eta$ in detail.

 The impact of SM parameter values on neutrino freeze-out and the discussion of the implications and connections of this work to other areas of physics, namely Big Bang nucleosynthesis and dark radiation can be found in detail in paper\cite{Birrell:2014uka}


 After neutrinos freezeout, the neutrino comoving entropy is independently conserved. However, the presence of electron-positron rich plasma until $T=20$keV provides the reaction $\gamma\gamma\to e^-e^+\to\nu\bar{\nu}$ to occur even after netruinos decouple from the cosmic plasma. This suggest the small amount of $e^\pm$ entropy can still transfer to neutrinos until temperature $T=20$ keV and can modify free streaming distribution and the effective number of neutrino. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Electron-Positron Epoch}\label{sec:ElectronPositron}
The electron-positron epoch of the early Universe was home to several significant events which have greatly shaped our contemporary Universe including neutrino decoupling, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the annihilation of most electrons and positrons partially re-ionizing the Universe, as well as setting the stage for the eventual recombination period which would generate the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Therefore, correctly describing the dynamics of this $e^{\pm}$ plasma is of interest when considering modern cosmic mysteries such as the origin of extra-galactic magnetic fields (EGMF). While most approaches tackle magnetized plasmas from the perspective of magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD), a primarily classical or semi-classical approach, our perspective is to demonstrate that fundamental quantum statistical analysis can lead to further insights on the behavior of magnetized plasmas.

The properties of the electron-positron $e^{\pm}$ plasma in the early Universe has not received appropriate attention in an era of precision BBN studies~\cite{Pitrou:2018cgg}. The presence of $e^{\pm}$ pairs before and during BBN has been acknowledged by Wang, Bertulani and Balantekin~\cite{Wang:2010px} over a decade ago. This however was before necessary tools were developed to explore the connection between electron and neutrino plasmas~\cite{Mangano:2005cc,Birrell:2012gg,Birrell:2014uka}. 

In \rf{Density_fig} we show that the dense $e^{\pm}$ plasma in early Universe under the hypothesis charge neutrality and entropy conservation as a function of temperature $2\,\mathrm{MeV}>T>10\,\mathrm{keV}$ \cite{Chris:2023abc}. The plasma is electron-positron rich, i.e, $n_{\pm}\gg n_B$ in the early Universe until leptonic annihilation at $T_{\mathrm{split}} = 20.36\ \mathrm{keV}$. For $T<T_{\mathrm{split}}$ the positron density $n_{e^+}$ decreases dramatically because of annihilation and the residual electron density becomes equal to the proton density in accordance with charge neutrality in the Universe as a whole.

As magnetic flux is conserved over co-moving surfaces, the primordial relic field is expected to dilute as $B\propto1/a(t)^{2}$ meaning the contemporary small bounded values of $5\times10^{-12}\ \mathrm{T}>B_{relic}>10^{-20}\ \mathrm{T}$ may have once represented large magnetic fields in the early Universe. This is relic magnetic field would then be generated by the last phase of significant magnetization in the early Universe. This figure is meant to be illustrative and it is unlikely the magnetization of the Universe would proceed unhindered and unaltered into the ultra-dense plasma phases of the early Universe. The values of the Schwinger critical field and the upper bound of surface magnetar field strength are included for scale. {\xred Move to introductory material and also move most text to text, caption defines variables and lines.}}
\end{figure}

We can now connect back to the consideration of cosmic magnetic fields as they might have risen in the environment of early Universe plasmas noting that such primordial magnetic fields would be lensed through each of the various plasmas that existed when the Universe was far hotter and denser. Of particular interest to us is the electron-positron plasma which existed in the early Universe especially at temperatures $T>35\ \mathrm{keV}$ which was the last matter(antimatter) plasma in the Universe where the energy its density exceeded that of the proton/neutron baryon energy density. This dense plasma environment is where BBN occurred and where similar plasmas can still be found within exotic stars such as magnetars. The contemporary relic magnetic fields may then be an artifact of this final time of Universe-scale magnetization in a manner similar to how the CMB is a relic of the time of charge recombination.

The Universe is filled with magnetic fields at various scales and strengths both within galaxies and in deep extra-galactic space far and away from matter sources. Extra-galactic magnetic fields are not well constrained today, but are required by observation to be non-zero with a magnitude between $10^{-12}\ \mathrm{T}>B_{EGMF}>10^{-20}\ \mathrm{T}$ over Mpc coherent length scales. The upper bound is constrained from the characteristics of the CMB while the lower bound is constrained by non-observation of ultra-energetic photons from blazars. There are generally considered two possible origins for extra-galactic magnetic fields: (a) matter-induced dynamo processes involving Amperian currents and (b) primordial (or relic) seed magnetic fields whose origins may go as far back as the Big Bang itself. It is currently unknown which origin accounts for extra-galactic magnetic fields today or if it some combination of the two models. Even if magnetic fields in the Universe today are primarily driven via amplification through Amperian matter currents, such models still require primordial seed fields at some point to act as catalyst.
\subsection{Electron-Positron Density Compared to Baryons}\label{subsec:ElectronPositronDensity}
\noindent During the late stages of the $e^{\pm}$ epoch where BBN occurred, the matter content of the Universe was still mostly dominated by the light charged leptons by many orders of magnitude even though the Hubble parameter was still mostly governed by the radiation behavior of the neutrinos and photons. The temperatures during this epoch were also cool enough that the electrons and positrons could be described non-relativistically to fairly good approximation while also still being as energy dense as the Solar core making it a relatively unique plasma environment not present elsewhere in cosmology. Considering the energy density between non-relativistic $e^{\pm}$ and baryon, it can be written as
\begin{align}\label{Eq_ratio}
\chi\equiv\frac{\rho_e+\rho_{\bar e}}{\rho_p+\rho_n}=\frac{m_e(n_e+n_{\bar e})}{m_pn_p+m_n n_n}=\frac{m_e(n_e+n_{\bar e})}{n_B(m_pX_p+m_nX_n)}=\left(\frac{n_e+n_{\bar e}}{n_B}\right)\,\left(\frac{m_e}{m_pX_p+{m_n X_\alpha}/2}\right)
\end{align}
where we consider all neutrons end up bound in to the $^4H_e$ after BBN  and from particle data group $X_p=n_p/n_B$ and $X_\alpha=n_\alpha/n_B$ and are given by
\begin{align}
X_p=0.878,\qquad X_\alpha=0.245
\end{align}
and masses are given by
\begin{align}
m_e=0.511\,\mathrm{MeV}, \qquad m_p=938.272\,\mathrm{MeV},\qquad m_n=939.565\,\mathrm{MeV}
\end{align}
In Fig.(\ref{ratio_fig}) we plot the energy density ratio Eq.(\ref{Eq_ratio}) as a function of temperature $10\,\mathrm{keV}< T<200\,\mathrm{keV}$. It shows that the energy density of electron and positron is dominated until $T=30.2$ keV, i.e.,  we have $\rho_{e}\gg\rho_B$. After $T=30.2$ keV, we have $\rho_{e}\ll\rho_B$ and ratio becomes constant when is around $T=20$keV because of the positron annihilation and charge neutrality.

\subsection{Energy Eigenvalues}\label{subsec:energy}
\noindent As a starting point, we consider the energy eigenvalues of charged fermions within a homogeneous magnetic field. Here, we have several choices: We could assume the typical Dirac energy eigenvalues with gyro-magnetic g-factor set to $g=2$. But as electrons, positrons and most plasma species have anomalous magnetic moments (AMM), we require a more complete model. Another option would be to modify the Dirac equation with a Pauli term, often called the Dirac-Pauli (DP) approach, via
\begin{align}
  \label{Pauli} \hat{H}_{\mathrm{AMM}} = -a\frac{e}{2m_{e}}\frac{\sigma_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}}{2}\,,
\end{align}
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is the spin tensor proportional to the commutator of the gamma matrices and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the EM field tensor. For the duration of this work, we will remain in natural units $(\hbar=c=k_{B}=1)$ unless explicitly stated otherwise. The AMM is defined via g-factor as
\begin{align}
  \label{AMM} \frac{g}{2}=1+a\,.
\end{align}
This approach, while straightforward, would complicate the energies making analytic understanding and clarity difficult without a clear benefit. Modifying the Dirac equation with \req{Pauli} yields the following eigen-energies
\begin{align}
  \label{DPEnergy} E_{n}^{s}\vert_{DP}=\sqrt{\left(\sqrt{m_{e}^{2}+2eB\left(n+\frac{1}{2}-s\right)}-\frac{eB}{2m}(g-2)s\right)^{2}+p_{z}^{2}}
\end{align}
This model for the electron-positron plasma of the early Universe has been used in work such as Strickland et. al. \cite{Strickland:2012vu}. Our work here is then in part a companion peice which compares and contrasts the DP model of fermions to our preferred model for the AMM via the Klein-Gordon-Pauli (KGP) equation given by
\begin{alignat}{1}
  \label{KGP} \left(\left(i\partial_{\mu}-eA_{\mu}\right)^{2}-m_{e}^{2}-e\frac{g}{2}\frac{\sigma_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\mu}}{2}\right)\Psi=0\,.
\end{alignat}
We wish to emphasize, that each of the three above models (Dirac, DP, KGP) are distinct and have differing physical consequences and are not interchangeable which we explored in the context of hydrogen-like atoms in \cite{Steinmetz:2018ryf}. Recent work done in \cite{Rafelski:2022bsv} discuss the benefits of KGP over other approaches for $g\neq2$ from a quantum field theory perspective. Exploring the statistical behavior of KGP in a cosmological contenxt can lead to new insights in magnetization which may be distinquished from pure $g=2$ behavior of the Dirac equation or the \emph{ad hoc} modification imposed by the Pauli term in DP. One major improvement of the KGP approach over the more standard DP approach is that the energies take eigenvalues which are mathematically similar to the Dirac energies. Considering the $e^\pm$ plasma in a uniform magnetic field $B$ pointing along the $z$-axis, the energy of $e^\pm$ fermions can be written as
\begin{align}
  \label{KGPEnergy} E_{n}^{s}&=\sqrt{p^2_z+\tilde{m}^2+2eBn},\qquad\tilde{m}^2=m^2_e+eB\left(1-gs\right),\qquad s=\pm\frac{1}{2},\qquad n=0,1,2,3,\dots
\end{align}
where $n$ is the principle quantum number for the Landau levels and $s$ is the spin quantum number. Here we introduce a notion of effective mass $\tilde{m}$ which inherits the spin-specific part of the energy adding them to the mass. This convention is also generalizable to further non-minimal electromagnetic models with more exotic energy contributions such that we write a general replacement as
\begin{align}
  \label{MagMass} m_{e}^{2}\rightarrow\tilde{m}^2(B)\,.
\end{align}
This definition also pulls out the ground state Landau energy separating it from the remainder of the Landau tower of states. One restriction is that the effective mass must remain positive definite in our analysis thus we require
\begin{align}
  \label{MassLimit} \tilde{m}^2(B)=m^2_e+eB\left(1-gs\right)>0\,.
\end{align}
This condition fails under ultra-strong magnetic fields of order
\begin{align}
  \label{MagMassFail} B_{\mathrm{crit}}=\frac{m_{e}^{2}}{ea}=\frac{\mathcal{B}_{S}}{a}\approx3.8\times10^{12}\ \mathrm{T}\,,
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{B}_{S}$ is the Schwinger critical field strength. For electrons, this field strength is well above the window of magnetic field strengths of interest during the late $e^{\pm}$ epoch.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Landau eigen-energies in cosmology}\label{subsec:Landau}
\noindent There is another natural scale for the magnetic field besides \req{MagMassFail} when considering the consequences of FLRW expansion on the $e^{\pm}$ fluid. As the Universe expands, different terms in the energies and thus partition function evolve as a function of the scale factor $a(t)$ which arises in the FLRW metric. We can consider the expansion to be an adiabatic process which results in a smooth shifting of the relevant dynamical quantities. From the conservation of magnetic flux through a co-moving surface, the magnetic field under expansion starting at some initial time $t_{0}$ is given by
\begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{BScale} B(t) = B(t_{0})\frac{a(t_{0})^{2}}{a(t)^{2}}\,.
\end{alignat}
As the Universe expands, the temperature also cools as the cosmological redshift reduces the momenta of particles in the Universe lowering their contribution to the energy content of the Universe. This cosmological redshift is written as
\begin{alignat}{1}
  \label{Redshift} p_{i}(t) = p_{i}(t_{0})\frac{a(t_{0})}{a(t)}\,,\qquad T(t) = T(t_{0})\frac{a(t_{0})}{a(t)}\,.
\end{alignat}
The momenta scale with the same factor as temperature as it is the origin of cosmological redshift. The energy of massive free particles in the Universe scales differently based on their momentum (and thus temperature). When hot and relativistic, particle energy scales with inverse scale factors like radiation. However as particles transition to non-relativistic momenta, their energies scale with the inverse square of the scale factor like magnetic flux.
\begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{EScale} E(t) = E(t_{0})\frac{a(t_{0})}{a(t)}\xrightarrow{\mathrm{NR}}\  E(t_{0})\frac{a(t_{0})^{2}}{a(t)^{2}}\,.
\end{alignat}
This occurs because of the functional dependence of energy on momentum in the relativistic versus non-relativistic cases. The argument in the Boltzmann statistical factor is given by
\begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{Boltz} X_{n}^{s}\equiv\frac{E_{n}^{s}}{T}\,.
\end{alignat}
We can explore this relationship for the magnetized system explicitly by writing out \req{Boltz} using the KGP eigen-energies as
\begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{XExplicit} X_{n}^{s} = \sqrt{\frac{m_{e}^{2}}{T^{2}}+\frac{p_{z}^{2}}{T^{2}}+\frac{2eB}{T^{2}}\left(n+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{gs}{2}\right)}\,,
\end{alignat}
where we now introduce the expansion scale factor via \req{BScale} - \req{Redshift}. The Boltzmann factor can then be written as
\begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{XScale} X_{n}^{s}[a(t)] = \sqrt{\frac{m_{e}^{2}}{T^{2}(t_{0})}\frac{a(t)^{2}}{a(t_{0})^{2}}+\frac{p_{z}^{2}(t_{0})}{T^{2}(t_{0})}+\frac{2eB(t_{0})}{T^{2}(t_{0})}\left(n+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{gs}{2}\right)}\,.
\end{alignat}
This reveals that only the mass contribution is dynamic over cosmological time. For any given eigen-state, the mass term increases driving the state into the non-relativistic limit while the momenta and magnetic contributions are frozen by initial conditions. As a point of comparison, the Boltzmann factor for the DP eigen-energies becomes
\begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{XDP} X_{n}^{s}\vert_{DP} = \sqrt{\left(\sqrt{\frac{m_{e}^{2}}{T^{2}}+\frac{2eB}{T^{2}}\left(n+\frac{1}{2}-s\right)}-\frac{eB}{2mT}(g-2)s\right)^{2}+\frac{p_{z}^{2}}{T^{2}}}\,,
\end{alignat}
which over cosmological time under expansion scales as
\begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{XScaleDP} X_{n}^{s}[a(t)]\vert_{DP} = \sqrt{\left(\sqrt{\frac{m_{e}^{2}}{T^{2}(t_{0})}\frac{a(t)^{2}}{a(t_{0})^{2}}+\frac{2eB(t_{0})}{T^{2}(t_{0})}\left(n+\frac{1}{2}-s\right)}-\frac{eB(t_{0})}{2mT(t_{0})}\frac{a(t_{0})}{a(t)}(g-2)s\right)^{2}+\frac{p_{z}^{2}(t_{0})}{T^{2}(t_{0})}}\,.
\end{alignat}
%We note here one important difference between KGP and DP eigen-energies in the context of cosmology: The anomalous magnetic moment portion of the DP statistics is suppressed by $1/a(t)$ over cosmological time while the AMM contribution is preserved in the KGP model. That the Universe's expansion makes a distinction between $g=2$ magnetic moment and AMM for DP fermions appears as a rather artificial and nonphysical trait. While the suppression of AMM may often be small for particles such as electrons, this suppression is non-trivial for particles with large AMM values such as the proton. That cosmological redshift would push DP protons to be described by $g=2$ eign-energies in the non-relativistic limit counts as a malaise for the model and further strengthens our thinking that the KGP model is more appropriate for cosmological studies.
It is interesting to note that both \req{XScale} and \req{XScaleDP} preserve the magnitude of the magnetic moment ($g=2$ and AMM portions) in the non-relativistic limit as $a(t)$ becomes large. Following reasoning outlined in \cite{Rafelski:2022bsv} and \cite{Steinmetz:2018ryf} we will proceed with out analysis using the eigen-energies provided by the KGP equation in favor over the DP equation. Motivated by \req{XScale}, we can introduce a dimensionless cosmic magnetic scale which is frozen in the homogeneous case as
\begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{Bo} b_{0}\equiv\frac{eB}{T^{2}}=\frac{eB\hbar c^{2}}{(k_{B}T)^{2}}\ \mathrm{(S.I)}\,,
\end{alignat}
where we've included the expression explicitly in full SI units. We can estimate the value of $b_{0}$ from the bounds on the extra-galactic magnetic field strength and the temperature of the Universe today.  If the origin of deep space extra-galactic magnetic fields are relic fields from the early Universe, which today are expected to exist between $5\times10^{-12}\ \mathrm{T}>B_{relic}>10^{-20}\ \mathrm{T}$, then at temperature $T=2.7\ \mathrm{K}$, the value of the cosmic magnetic scale is between
\begin{alignat}{1}
    \label{BoScale} 5.5\times10^{-5}>b_{0}>1.1\times10^{-11}\,.
\end{alignat}
This should remain constant in the Universe at-large up to the last epoch the Universe was sufficiently magnetized to disturb this value. As the electron-proton plasma which generated the CMB was relatively dilute over its duration, it was unlikely sufficiently magnetized to significantly alter this value over extra-galactic scales. Rather, the best candidate plasma to have been sufficiently magnetized and dense to have set the relic field magnetic scale would have been the electron-positron plasma which existed during the duration of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and beforehand.

Higher order non-minimal magnetic contributions which can be introduced via \req{MagMass} to the eigen-energies like $\approx\mu_{B}^{2}B^{2}/T^{2}$ are even more surpressed over cosmological time which drives the system into minimal electromagnetic coupling with the exception of the anomalous magnetic moment in the KGP case. It is interesting to note that cosmological expansion serves to \lq\lq smooth out\rq\rq\ the characteristics of more complex BSM electrodynmaics erasing them from a statistical perspective in favor of the minimal or minimal-like dynamics. As $b_0$ is a constant of expansion, assuming the electron-proton plasma between the CMB and electron-positron annihilation did not greatly disturbed it, we can calculate the remnant values at the temperature $T=50\ \mathrm{keV}$ with the expression
\begin{align}
  \label{BBNFields} B(T)=\frac{b_{0}}{e}T^{2}\,,
\end{align}
yielding a range of field strengths
\begin{align}
  \label{BBNRange} 2.3\times10^{5}\ \mathrm{T}>B(T=50\ \mathrm{keV})>4.6\times10^{-4}\ \mathrm{T}\,,
\end{align}
during which the electron-positron plasma in the Universe had a number density comparable to that of the Solar core with $n_{e}=4.49\times10^{24}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ at $r=0.01R_{\odot}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Electron-positron statistical physics}\label{subsec:Partition}
\noindent We now turn our attention now to the statistical behavior of the $e^{\pm}$ system. We can utilize the general fermion partition function given by
\begin{align}
  \label{PartFunc} \ln\mathcal{Z}=\sum_{\alpha}\ln\left(1+e^{-\beta(E-\eta)}\right)\,,
\end{align}
where $\beta=1/T$, $\alpha$ is the set of all quantum numbers in the system, and $\eta$ is the generalized chemical potential. The magnetized $e^{\pm}$ system should be considered a system of four quantum species: Particles and anti-particles, and spin aligned and anti-aligned. Taken together we consider a system where all electrons and positrons are spin aligned or anti-aligned with the magnetic field $B$ and the partition function of the system is written as
\begin{align}
  \label{PartFuncB}\ln\mathcal{Z}_{tot}=\frac{2eBV}{(2\pi)^2}\sum_{\sigma}^{\pm1}\sum_{s}^{\pm1/2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\int^\infty_{0}dp_z\left[\ln\left(1+\Upsilon_{\sigma}^{s}(x)e^{-\beta E_{n}^{s}}\right)\right]\,,\\
  \label{Fugacity}\Upsilon_{\sigma}^{s}(x)=\gamma(x)\lambda_{\sigma}^{s}\,,\qquad\lambda_{\sigma}^{s}=e^{\sigma\eta_{e}+s\eta_{s}}\,,
\end{align}
where $\eta_{e}$ is the electron chemical potential and $\eta_s$ is the spin chemical potential for the generalized fugacity $\lambda_{\sigma}^{s}$. The parameter $\gamma(x)$ is a spatial field which controls the distribution inhomogeneity of the fermi gas. Inhomogeneities can arrise from the influence of other forces on the gas such as gravitational forces. Deviations of $\gamma\neq1$ represent configurations of reduced entropy (maximum entropy is the regular distribution itself with $\gamma=1$) without pulling the system off a thermal temperature. This is precisely the kind of behavior that may arise in the $e^{\pm}$ epoch as the dominant photon thermal bath keeps the fermi gas in thermal equilibrium while spatial inequilibria could spontanerously develop. The energy $E_{n}^\pm$ can be written as
\begin{align}
E_{n}^\pm&=\sqrt{p^2_z+\tilde m^2_\pm+2eBn},\qquad\tilde{m}^2_\pm=m^2_e+eB\left(1\mp\frac{g}{2}\right)\,,
\end{align}
where the $\pm$ script refers to spin aligned and anti-aligned eigenvalues. As the temperature domain we're interested is in the $T=50\ \mathrm{keV}$ range, we can take a semi-relativistic approach of the electron-positron plasma by considering the partition function obtained in the Boltzmann approximation $k=1$. In following we considering the case $\eta_s/T\ll1$ for the first approximation and Boltzmann approximation for nonrelativistic electrons and positrons. Using the Euler-Maclaurin formula to replace the sum over Landau levels with an integration yielding
\begin{align}
  \ln\mathcal{Z}_{tot}=\ln\mathcal{Z}_{free}+\ln\mathcal{Z}_B+\ln\mathcal{Z}_R\,,
\end{align}
where we define 
\begin{align}
  \label{FreePart}&\ln\mathcal{Z}_{free}=\frac{T^3V}{2\pi^2}\left[2\cosh{\left(\frac{\eta_{e}}{T}\right)}\right]\sum_{i=\pm}x_i^2K_2\left(x_i\right)\,,\\
  \label{MagPart}&\ln\mathcal{Z}_B=\frac{eBTV}{2\pi^2}\left[2\cosh{\left(\frac{\eta_{e}}{T}\right)}\right]\sum_{i=\pm}\bigg[\frac{x_i}{2}K_1\left(x_i\right)+\frac{k^2b_0}{12}K_0\left(x_i\right)\bigg]\,,\\
  \label{ErrorPart}&\ln\mathcal{Z}_R=\frac{eBTV}{\pi^2}\left[2\cosh{\left(\frac{\eta_{e}}{T}\right)}\right]R.
\end{align}
where $R$ is the error remainder which is defined by integrals over Bernoulli polynomials.
While this would require further derivation to demonstrate explicitly, the benefit of the Euler-Maclaurin approach is if the error contribution remains finite or bound for the magnetized partition function, then a correspondence between the free Fermi partition function (with noticeably modified effective mass $\tilde{m}_{\pm}$) and the magnetized Fermi partition function can be established. The mismatch between the summation and integral in the Euler-Maclaurin formula would then encapsulate the immediate magnetic response and deviation from the free particle phase space. While we label $\ln(\mathcal{Z}_{free})$ in \req{FreePart} as the \lq\lq free\rq\rq\ partition function, this is not strictly true as this contribution to the overall partition function is a function of the effective mass we defined earlier in \req{MagMass}. When determining the magnetization of the quantum Fermi gas, derivatives of the magnetic field $B$ will not fully vanish on this first term which will resulting in an intrinsic magnetization which is distinct from the contribution from the ground state and mismatch between the quantized Landau levels and the continuum of the free momentum. Specifically, this free Fermi contribution represents the magnetization that arises from the spin magnetic energy rather than orbital contributions.

Assuming the error remainder $R$ is small and can be neglected, we can rewrite \req{FreePart} - \req{MagPart} obtaining
\begin{align}
  \label{lnZ}
  \ln\mathcal{Z}_{tot}=\frac{T^3V}{2\pi^2}\left[2\cosh\left(\frac{\eta_{e}}{T}\right)\right]\sum_{i=\pm}\left\{x_i^{2} K_2\left(x_i\right)+\frac{b_0}{2}x_iK_1\left(x_i\right)+\frac{b^2_0}{12}K_0\left(x_i\right)\right\}\,.
\end{align}
\req{lnZ} is a surprisingly compact expression containing only tractable functions and will be our working model for the remainder of the work. Note that the above does not take into consideration density inhomogeneities and is restricted to the domain where the plasma is well described as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. With that said, we have not taken the non-relativistic expansion of the eigen-energies.

\subsection{Charge neutrality and chemical potential}
 In this section we are interested in exploring the chemical potential of dense $e\bar e$ plasma in early Universe under the hypothesis charge neutrality and entropy conservation. We focus on the temperature interval at post-BBN temperature range $20<T<50$keV. In this case, the charge neutrality can be written as
\begin{align}
  \label{density_proton}
  \left(n_{e}-n_{\bar{e}}\right)=(n_{p})=\left(\frac{n_{p}}{n_{B}}\right)\,\left(\frac{n_{B}}{s_{\gamma,\nu,e}}\right)\,s_{\gamma,\nu,e}= X_p\left(\frac{n_B}{s_{\gamma,\nu}}\right)\,s_{\gamma,\nu},\qquad X_p=\frac{n_p}{n_B}
\end{align}
where $n_B$ is the number density of baryon, and the entropy density is obtained by considering the contribution of $e^\pm$ in entropy density is negligible compared to the photon and neutrino entropy density at post-BBN temperature $20<T<50$keV because the low density $n_e\ll n_{\gamma,\nu}$. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Since all neutrons end up bound in to the $^4H_e$ after BBN, then the mass fraction of $^4H_e$ can be estimated as \cite{ParticleDataGroup:2022pth}
\begin{align}
X_\alpha=\frac{2(n_n/n_p)}{1+n_n/n_p}=0.245\pm0.03.
\end{align} 
 Solving the ratio $n_n/n_p$ and substituting into the $X_p$, we obtain
\begin{align}
 X_p=\frac{n_p}{n_B}=\frac{n_p}{n_p+n_n}=\frac{1}{1+n_n/n_p}=0.878\pm0.015
\end{align}

  \item Since the comoving baryon number and entropy are conserved, hence the ratio $s_{\gamma,\nu}/n_B$ is conserved, then the entropy per baryon ratio can be written as
\begin{align}
\left(\frac{s_{\gamma,\nu}}{n_B}\right)=\left(\frac{s_{\gamma,\nu}}{n_B}\right)_{\!\!t_0}\!\!=\left(\frac{n_\gamma}{n_B}\right)_{\!\!t_0}\left(\frac{s_\gamma}{n_\gamma}+\frac{n_\nu}{n_\gamma}\frac{s_\nu}{n_\nu}\right)=\left(\frac{n_\gamma}{n_B}\right)_{\!\!t_0}\left[3.601+\frac{9}{4}\left(\frac{T_\nu}{T_\gamma}\right)^{\!\!3}4.202\right],
\end{align}
where the subscript $t_0$ denotes the present-day value and considers all neutrinos are relativistic particles today. The entropy per particle for a boson is $(s/n)_\mathrm{boson}=3.601$ and for a fermion is $(s/n)_\mathrm{fermion}=4.202$. From particle data group and standard big bang model \cite{ParticleDataGroup:2022pth,Kolb:1990vq}, we have
\begin{align}
&5.8\times10^{-10}<\frac{n_B}{n_\gamma}<6.5\times10^{-10},\quad\frac{T_\nu}{T_\gamma}=\left(\frac{4}{11}\right)^{1/3}.
\end{align}

  \item The entropy density at temperature can be written as \cite{Kolb:1990vq}
\begin{align}
s=\frac{2\pi^2}{45}g_sT_\gamma^3,\qquad g_s=\sum_{i=boson}g_i\left(\frac{T_i}{T_\gamma}\right)^3+\frac{7}{8}\sum_{i=fermion}g_i\left(\frac{T_i}{T_\gamma}\right)^3
\end{align}
where $g_s$ is the effective degree of freedom that contribute to the entropy density.  
\end{itemize}
 
On the other hand, given the partition function in Boltzmann limit \req{lnZ} the net number density of electron can be written as
\begin{align}
\left(n_e-n_{\bar e}\right)&=\frac{T}{V}\frac{\partial}{\partial \eta_{e}}\ln\mathcal{Z}_{tot}=\frac{T^3}{2\pi^2}\left[2\sinh{(\eta_{e}/T)}\right]\sum_{i=\pm}\left[x_i^2K_2(x_i)+\frac{b_0}{2}x_i K_1(x_i)+\frac{b^2_0}{12}K_0(x_i)\right]
\end{align}
Using the charge neutrality Eq.(\ref{density_proton}) and solving the chemical potential, we obtain:
\begin{align}\label{ChemicalPotential}
\sinh{(\eta_{e}/T)}&=\frac{2\pi^2}{2T^3}\,\frac{X_p(n_B/s_{\gamma,\nu})s_{\gamma,\nu}}{\sum_{i=\pm}\left[x_i^2K_2(x_i)+\frac{b_0}{2}x_i K_1(x_i)+\frac{b^2_0}{12}K_0(x_i)\right]}\\
&\longrightarrow\frac{2\pi^2n_p}{2T^3}\,\frac{X_p(n_B/s_{\gamma,\nu})s_{\gamma,\nu}}{2x^2K_2(x)},\qquad x=m_e/T,\qquad \mathrm{for}\,\,b_0=0
\end{align}
It shows that for the case $b_0=0$ the chemical potential agrees with our earlier results \cite{Chris:2023abc}.
In {\rf{chemical_fig}}, we solve the Eq.(\ref{ChemicalPotential}) numerically and plot the  chemical potential as a function of temperature $T$. It shows that the chemical potential is not sensitive to the magnetic field because the small value of $b_0=10^{-5}\sim10^{-11}$ and can be neglected in \req{ChemicalPotential}.

In {\rf{chemical_fig}}, we plot the  chemical potential as a function of temperature $T$. It shows that the chemical potential is not sensitive to the magnetic field because the small value of $b_0=10^{-3}\sim10^{-8}$ and can be neglected in \req{ChemicalPotential}.

\subsection{Magnetization}\label{subsec:Magnetization}
Given the partition function \req{lnZ} the magnetization can be obtained via the definition
\begin{align}
M=\frac{T}{V}\frac{\partial \ln\mathcal{Z}_{tot}}{\partial B}=\frac{T}{V}\left(\frac{\partial\tilde m_\pm}{\partial B}\right)\frac{\partial \ln\mathcal{Z}_{tot}}{\partial\tilde m_\pm}
\end{align}
then the magnetization can be written as
\begin{align}\label{Magnetization}
\left(\frac{M}{B}\right)=\frac{4\pi\alpha}{2\pi^2b_0}\left[2\cosh\left(\frac{\eta_{e}}{T}\right)\right]\sum_{i=\pm}\left\{\left[\frac{1}{2}-\frac{(1+i g/2)}{2}\left(1+\frac{b^2_0}{12x^2_i}\right)\right]x_i K_1(x_i)+\left[\frac{1}{6}-\frac{(1+ig/2)}{4}\right]b_0K_0(x_i)\right\}.
\end{align}
Substituting the chemical potential \req{ChemicalPotential} into \req{Magnetization} we can solve the magnetization $M/B$ numerically.
Considering the case $g=2$ the magnetization becomes
\begin{align}
\left(\frac{M}{B}\right)=\left(\frac{M}{B}\right)_++\left(\frac{M}{B}\right)
_-
\end{align}
where the functions $(M/B)_\pm$ are defined as 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Case1: $\tilde m_+=\sqrt{m^2_e+2eB}$, and $x_+=\tilde m_+/T$. The magnetization is given by
  \begin{align}\label{Magnetization_001}
 \left(\frac{M}{B}\right)_+&=-\frac{8\pi\alpha}{2\pi^2}\sqrt{1+\sinh^2(\eta_e/T)}\left[\left(\frac{1}{2b_0}+\frac{b_0}{12x_+^2}\right)x_+K_1(x_+)+\frac{1}{3}K_0(x_+)\right]
   \end{align}
Substituting the magnetic field $b_0$ and proton density $n_p/T^3$  we can solve the magnetization and chemical potential numerically. In \rf{Case1_fig}, we plot the  magnetization $M/B$ as a function of temperature $T$. It shows for the case1 the magnetization is not sensitive to the magnetic field, this is because the small value of $b_0=10^{-3}\sim10^{-8}$ and can be neglected in \req{chemical_001} and \req{Magnetization_001}.
\\
  \item Case 2: $\tilde m_-=m_e$ and $x=\tilde m_-/T$,then the magnetization of electron/ positron becomes
\begin{align}\label{Magnetization_002}
\left(\frac{M}{B}\right)_-&=\frac{8\pi\alpha}{2\pi^2}\sqrt{1+\sinh^2(\eta_e/T)}\left(\frac{1}{b_0}x_-K_1(x_-)+\frac{1}{6}K_0(x_-)\right)
\end{align}
Using the magnetic field $b_0$ and proton density $n_p/T^3$ we solve the magnetization  numerically. In \rf{Case2_fig}, we plot the  magnetization $M/B$ as a function of temperature $T$. It shows that the magnetization depends on the magnetic field $b_0$ strongly. This is because for a small magnetic field $b_0$ the dominant term in \req{Magnetization_002} is $xK_1(x)/b_0$. For given $b_0$, the value of magnetization can be larger than the magnetic field, i.e. $M/B>1$  which shows the possibility that magnetic domains can be formed in the early Universe.

\section{Summary}

\section{Andrew's Notes. Will Delete.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\xred Introducing the major topics of the paper. The \lq\lq five\rq\rq\ plasma epochs in the Universe with some sub-epochs detailed and a brief dive into $e^{\pm}$ plasma as our bread and butter. First paragraph should emphasize the anti-matter of the early Universe.}
  \item {\xred If the Universe is symmetric in matter/antimatter, then the Universe domain we reside in antimatter disappears as a major component at 20 keV.}
  \item {\xred This paper does NOT resolve matter/antimatter asymmetry, rather it explores the consequences of evolution once that asymmetry is already present.}
  \item {\xred We cutoff discussion at 20 keV as antimatter from the Big Bang has disappeared with the loss of the positrons. Antimatter is then only from secondary processes, and the matter Universe (electron-proton) further cools resulting in recombination and the CMB. Then observational cosmology begins.}
  \item {\xred The electron-light nuclei domain is more the area of standard cosmology. It has not been appreciated that antimatter was so prevalent above 20 keV thus that is where our efforts reside.}
  \item {\xred 80th birthday is a good opportunity to remember Remo Ruffini's contribution to astrophysics and our mutual interest in the cosmic evolution of the Universe. First paragraph is organizational. What's we're talking about and why. Add some RR references with explicitly electron-positron content, also note our work could potential be a model of GRB.}
  \item {\xred Section on neutrino oscillation, and mass models, and magnetic moments.}
  \item {\xred Note that in the early leptonic epoch, the ratios of energy densities is fixed by the number of species allowed which is why the order of energy density goes neutrino, electrons, then photons.}
\end{itemize}
